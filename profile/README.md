# Live Every Week Labs — Open Source

Welcome to **Live Every Week Labs**’ open-source corner 👋  
This is where we publish and maintain the tools, libraries, and experiments we build in public.

## What you'll find here

### ✅ Active / shipping
- **GraphQL Docs** — The current home for our GraphQL documentation and examples.

### 🧪 In the works
- **Hone** — A skill manager/workflow tool (coming soon).  
  Goal: make it easier to create, share, and maintain AI “skills” across projects.

## Philosophy

We optimize for:
- **Practical tooling** over novelty
- **Great DX** (clear docs, good errors, predictable APIs)
- **Small, composable modules**
- **Real-world production use** (not just demos)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome—issues, PRs, docs fixes, examples, or feature requests.

**General guidelines:**
- Prefer small, focused PRs
- Include reproduction steps for bugs
- Add or update tests when applicable
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes

If a repo has additional contribution rules, it will include a `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Security

If you discover a security issue, please avoid filing a public issue.  
Instead, email the maintainers or follow the repo’s `SECURITY.md` (if present).

## Licensing

Unless otherwise noted, projects in this org are open source under the license included in each repository (see `LICENSE` in the repo root).

## Contact

- GitHub Issues: best for bugs + feature requests
- Discussions (if enabled): best for questions and ideas
